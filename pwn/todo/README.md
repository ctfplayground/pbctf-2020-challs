## Description
I didn't pay my friend to complete this final project assignment. Though I know
my friend is also always struggling with `new`/`delete` stuff so I guess I
struggle with that too.

Also to tell you the truth, I hate commenting my code, always a hassle to do so
([real programmers][1] don't need to read any comments to understand the 
program).

p.s. i wrote this when i was young pls forgive me.

## Solution
See `soln` folder
