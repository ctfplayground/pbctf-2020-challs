# cpuback

**Category**: Pwn

**Author**: vakzz

**Description**:
Someone was handing out free cpus at the mall so I grabbed a couple! They seem to work fine, I wonder why they were giving them away...

Login is ctf/ctf

**Hints**: One of the functions seems pretty suspicious...

**Solution**: Either here if short, or write a WRITEUP.md file somewhere
