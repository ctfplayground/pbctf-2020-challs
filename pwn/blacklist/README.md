# Blacklist

**Category**: Pwn

**Author**: theKidOfArcrania

**Description**: Last time, we were [just kidding][1], about that program being
unexploitable.  This time we are 100% serious: it's totally safe because
seccomp(TM) is(TM) SO(TM) secure(TM)!

Anyways, I hid the flag in some random file under `/flag_dir`. I'll even give
you our docker environment (sans flag, of course) to help you test out your
exploit (of course totally, you'll soon find that the flag is so secure!)
I am soooo generous!
