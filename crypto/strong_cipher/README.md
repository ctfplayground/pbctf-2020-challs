# Strong Cipher

**Category**: Crypto

**Author**: rbtree

**Description**: 

Multiplication is better than addition.

**Hints**:
 * None.

**Public files**: 
 * dist/binary
 * dist/ciphertext

## Solution

The given binary uses a `GF2P8MULB` instruction, which multiplies each byte in
the finite field `GF(2^8)`, and the encryption algorithm is similar to the XOR
cipher or the Vigen√®re cipher.

Therefore, it's possible to solve the challenge by modifying an existing XOR
cipher solver, for example, hellman's xortool (https://github.com/hellman/xortool).

The given gf2p8multool is a modification of the xortool.
