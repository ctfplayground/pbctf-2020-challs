**Description**: Our team strives to stay up-to-date with latest technologies. Somebody told me that I can secure my code if I use crypto on it. Drumrolls.. We are releasing pbcoin which can perform cryptographic operations on blockchain. ðŸ˜Ž We will be the talk of security town soon. But, can you see if you can crack the ciphertext which I generated from this blockchain mess?

Note: Please wrap flag inside `pbctf{}` before submitting. Flag charset is [a-z]

**Hints**:
 * Look for constants to know what algorithms could have been used
 * Dynamic Debugging can help only if you can haz skills to patch the bytecode
 * TBD
